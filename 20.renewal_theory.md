What does the renewal process describe?
========================================

Replacement of component.

failure time
-------------

A population of components, the failure time of each component is characterized by a non-negative random variable X. The failure time is in fact the *age* of the component, defining when the failure occurs.

The distribution of X could be either discrete or continuous.
Discrete: X~{0,h,2h,3h,...}
Continuous: the probability is determined by a probability density function (pdf) over the range of (0,$\infty$).

probability density function of X
-----------------------------------

$$f(x)=\lim_{\Delta x \to 0_+} \frac{\mathrm{prob}(x<X<x+\Delta x)}{\Delta x}$$

with

$$\int_0^{\infty} f(x) dx =1.$$

And the failure times are independent.

Other functions
------------------

cumulative distribution function $F(x)$:

$$F(x) = \mathrm{prob}(X<=x)
       = \int_-^x f(u) du.$$

and $f(x)=F\textprime (x)$


survivor function $\mathscr{F}(x)$:
$$\mathscr{F}(x)= \mathrm{prob(X>x)}\\
                = 1-F(x)\\
                = \int_x^{\infty} f(u) du$$

$f(x)=-\mathscr{F}\textprime (x)$


Life table events
=======================

A life table consists of a list of the number of individuals, usually from an initial group of 1000 individuals so that the numbers are effectively proportions, who survive to a given age in a given population.

Important parameters:

$\mathcsr{l}_x$: surviving to age $x$

$d_x$: dying between age x and x+1

$d_x = \mathscr{x}-\mathscr{x+1}$
