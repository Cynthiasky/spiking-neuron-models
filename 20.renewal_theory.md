What does the renewal process describe?
========================================

Replacement of component.

failure time
-------------

A population of components, the failure time of each component is characterized by a non-negative random variable X. The failure time is in fact the *age* of the component, defining when the failure occurs.

The distribution of X could be either discrete or continuous.
Discrete: X~{0,h,2h,3h,...}
Continuous: the probability is determined by a probability density function (pdf) over the range of (0,$\infty$).

probability density function of X
-----------------------------------

$$f(x)=\lim_{\Delta x \to 0_+} \frac{\mathrm{prob}(x<X<x+\Delta x)}{\Delta x}$$

with

$$\int_0^{\infty} f(x) dx =1.$$

And the failure times are independent.
