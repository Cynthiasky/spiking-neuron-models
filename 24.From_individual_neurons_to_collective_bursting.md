This is a short introduction and rationale to my [PhD subject](http://www.msc.univ-paris-diderot.fr/spip.php?rubrique378&lang=fr) on organized behaviors in neuronal networks, focusing on collective bursting in neuronal cultures.

**Contents:**
  - Introduction to the aEIF model to describe the neuronal dynamics
  - Network topology in cultures
  - Synchronization in homogeneous networks
  - The mean-field model

## Neuronal dynamics and the aEIF model

As described in the previous sessions on neuronal models, we use simplified equations to describe the behavior of neurons.
How far should we simplify them? For physicists, the best way is to keep the model 2D, so that you can always represent the evolution of the neuron's state on a piece of paper, but make it discontinuous so that it can also have a chaotic behavior.

For that reason, we will here use the adaptive Exponential Integrate-and-Fire model (a.k.a. aEIF or AdEx).
In addition to being 2D, this model also recovers a large number of biologically relevant features compared to the IAF, the Izhikevitch, or GIF models.
