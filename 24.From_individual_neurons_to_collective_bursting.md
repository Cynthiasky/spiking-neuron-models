This is a short introduction and rationale to my [PhD subject](http://www.msc.univ-paris-diderot.fr/spip.php?rubrique378&lang=fr) on organized behaviors in neuronal networks, focusing on collective bursting in neuronal cultures.

**Contents:**
  - Introduction to the aEIF model to describe the neuronal dynamics
  - Network topology in cultures
  - Synchronization in homogeneous networks
  - The mean-field model


## 1. Neuronal dynamics and the aEIF model

### Principle
As described in the previous sessions on neuronal models, we use simplified equations to describe the behavior of neurons.
How far should we simplify them? For physicists, the best way is to keep the model 2D, so that you can always represent the evolution of the neuron's state on a piece of paper, but make it discontinuous so that it can also have a chaotic behavior.

For that reason, we will here use the adaptive Exponential Integrate-and-Fire model (a.k.a. aEIF or AdEx) [Brette2005](#brette2005).
In addition to being 2D, this model also recovers a large number of biologically relevant features compared to the IAF, the Izhikevitch, or GIF models.

The model describes the behavior of a neuron using only two variables: the membrane potential $\tilde{V}$, and a slow current $\tilde{w}$, which conveys the capacity of the neuron to adapt, i.e. to modulate its excitability depending on the input it receives.

### Equations
The two variables are coupled through the following equations:

$$
\begin{equation}
	\left\lbrace \begin{array}{l}
		\tilde{C}_m \frac{d\tilde{V}}{d\tilde{t}} = - \tilde{g}_L(\tilde{V}-\tilde{E}_L) + \tilde{g}_L \tilde{\Delta}_T \exp\left(\frac{\tilde{V}-\tilde{V}_{th}}{\tilde{\Delta}_T}\right) - \tilde{w} + \tilde{I}_e + \tilde{I}_s\\
		\tilde{\tau}_w \frac{d\tilde{w}}{d\tilde{t}} = \tilde{a} (\tilde{V} - \tilde{E}_L) - \tilde{w}
	\end{array}\right.
\end{equation}
$$

as in the integrate-and-fire model, the spike is terminated by a reset condition, which reads:

$$
\begin{equation}
	\text{if } \tilde{V} > \tilde{V}_{peak} \quad \left\lbrace \begin{array}{r c l}
		\tilde{V} &\leftarrow & \tilde{V}_r\\
		\tilde{w} &\leftarrow & \tilde{w} + \tilde{b}
	\end{array}\right.
	\label{eq:AdEx_adim}
\end{equation}
$$

For simplicity, I will use dimensionless variables in the rest of the session. The equations will thus become:

$$
\begin{equation}
	\left\lbrace \begin{array}{l}
		\dot{V} = - (V-E_L) + e^{V} - w + I_e + I_s\\
		\tau_w \dot{w} = a (V - E_L) - w
	\end{array}\right.
\end{equation}
$$

See [Appendices -- Variable change](#var_change) for details.

### Behavior
This model is able to reproduce almost all behaviors observed in electrophysiological recordings, from fast-spiking to intrisically bursting or chattering neurons [Naud2008](#naud2008).


## 2. Neuronal networks in cultures

Now that we have the neuronal model, let us have a look at the structure that will underly the system.\\
The neurons are coupled by synapses, so this structure can be represented simply by a directed network, described by an adjacency matrix **A**, where:
$$ A_{ij} = s_{ij} \delta(i \rightarrow j) $$
i.e. the matrix entry is non-zero only of neuron $i$ extends an axon towards $j$, in which case it's value represents the synaptic strength of the connection.

In cultures, the connectivity is much simpler than in the brain, since the structure is planar (at least in the cultures we study).
Though the network cannot be considered as fully homogeneous, as what was considered in previous sessions, some studies [Cohen2010](#cohen2010) suggest that its heterogeneity is rather limited.\\
Indeed, it seems that the in-degree connectivity can described by a Gaussian distribution, with an average degree of the order of 100.
