This is a short introduction and rationale to my [PhD subject](http://www.msc.univ-paris-diderot.fr/spip.php?rubrique378&lang=fr) on organized behaviors in neuronal networks, focusing on collective bursting in neuronal cultures.

**Contents:**
  - Introduction to the aEIF model to describe the neuronal dynamics
  - Network topology in cultures
  - Synchronization in homogeneous networks
  - The mean-field model

## Neuronal dynamics and the aEIF model
