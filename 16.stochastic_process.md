Noise types motivated in single neuron models
================================================

escape noise:
-----------------

focus on firing threshold, replace fixed firing threshold with firing probability based on the difference between firing threshold and membrane potential ($f(u-\theta)$).

slow noise:
---------------

focus on refractory time.


diffusive noise:
--------------------

focus on stochastic synaptic inputs to the neuron, which leads to fluctuations of membrane potential. Firing or not is based on the distribution of membrane potential.




From diffusive noise to escape noise
